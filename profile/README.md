## This organization hosts the projects designed and developed by the UNIRSM Information Design Lab students. 

The Information Design laboratory, developed on two integrated modules, aims to introduce students to the design of communicative artifacts that aim to convey complex information and themes and offer a broad view on the value, potential and limits of data.
The students, organized into working groups, will start from the selection of a research topic which they will develop through the selection and visual analysis of datasets that represent some of its dimensions. After an initial phase of analysis, students will have to develop a project made up of three elements: a digital publication capable of presenting the theme and the data analysed; an installation/communication campaign capable of bringing the digital experience back into a physical space; a video that tells the whole experience in all its significant phases.
During the training course, students will be introduced to tools and methodologies that aim to develop their communicative, graphic and design skills, making them more aware of the role they can assume in the communication and rendering of complex issues and information.
Together with the final project, individual tests will be assigned during the course with the aim of evaluating the technical and design growth of the students.
